<h3>Major League</h3>

<h3>Moneyball</h3>
<p>A thrilling true story that is also pretty funny. Character are amazing and leaving wondering what's next even if you already know the story.</p>

<h3>For Love of the Game</h3>
<p>Who ever has said there is no crying in baseball has never seen for the love of the game. It has something for everyone its funny at times its a love story and its baseball. Told over the course of a baseball game through flash backs but feels well put together at the same time.</p>
